+// DummyHost is a hostname used for local communication.
+//
+// It acts as a valid formatted hostname for local connections (such as "unix://"
+// or "npipe://") which do not require a hostname. It should never be resolved,
+// but uses the special-purpose ".localhost" TLD (as defined in [RFC 2606, Section 2]
+// and [RFC 6761, Section 6.3]).
+//
+// [RFC 7230, Section 5.4] defines that an empty header must be used for such
+// cases:
+//
+//	If the authority component is missing or undefined for the target URI,
+//	then a client MUST send a Host header field with an empty field-value.
+//
+// However, [Go stdlib] enforces the semantics of HTTP(S) over TCP, does not
+// allow an empty header to be used, and requires req.URL.Scheme to be either
+// "http" or "https".
